# BigO



## Time Complexity

slope = mx+b




## Space Complexity



O(n) = Linear
consistent behavior - horizontal slope
Example: O(1): looping through single array by index
unshift and shift are O(n) where n is # of items in array

O(n^t): Quadratic
slope grows exponentionally
Example : nested loops, find

O(2^n): Exponentioanl
Example:

log(n) : Inverse of exponent
Phone book -
a. flip through pages
b. open half each time - then go forward or backward
