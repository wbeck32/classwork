senior developer - don't let a project go off the rails. keep moving forward.

TCP is byte-level protocol. It doesn't care about the content of your data, but it guarantees that your data has been sent correctly



send json object as JSON.stringify();

HTTP is like an envelope - headers, metadata - it relies on TCP
TCP sends the data

comes to server as an HTTP request

alter data by using JSON.parse() to turn it back to json object and puts it into memory.


on the server
- each module is wrapped in an imaginary function
- modules enter queue and run in order
- the node process on the client ends when the queue is empty

event loop - runs the functions

waiting room - for timeout functions. when function is timed out, goes into the queue then to the event loop

throw is a synchronous concept

callback is for asynchronous
