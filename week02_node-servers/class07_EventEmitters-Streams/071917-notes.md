Every time a request comes in, we get an event emitter
events



These are sent back to the listeners
sequential
parallel
propagate errors

## incrementers and decrementers

`if ++i,
i returns i + 1`

if i++ i returns the curent value, then increments

if i = 0
if(!--i) (this means if i ==0)

this is a Promise
someAsync(23)
.then(data => {...})

if a buffer is returned, must specify utf8 to read/write


## promisify

don't nest promises

rarely create new Promise

`return new Promise(resolve, reject) => {
  const ms = 5000;
  setTimeout(() ={

  }, ms);
}`

bluebird - promise engine

Promise.all - doesn't resolve until all the promises are present this works if the functions don't depend on each other; they can all be run at the same time
