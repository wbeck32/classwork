## Code of Conduct

Let's [read it](https://github.com/codefellowspdx/code-of-conduct)!

Two parts:
* We want everyone to be able to do their best learning
    * On you to be aware of limiting others
        * SPEAK
        * IDEATE
        * LEAD
    * They don't know...
* Plagiarism
    * Rewrite, don't clipboard
    * Attribute
    * Beware time crunches!

### Grading

#### Process

You are required to show
1. a clear commit history,
2. with incremental steps,
3. and iterative improvements.

Up to 50% deduction will be taken off your score.

#### Testing

We will use TravisCI to automatically run your test suite when you submit your PR.

If your PR does not pass Travis, your assignment will not be graded. On you to know,
we are not here to notify you.

#### Be Timely

* You can resubmit an incomplete assignment and get full credit.
* A late submit is a forever 2pt deduction

Bottom line: 
* Submit what you have by the deadline
* More concerned with how you are spending 
your time if you have nothing to submit
* Work incrementally and this should never be a problem...

#### Redoing Labs

* The first time you do a lab, it will seem like climbing a mountain
* The second time will feel like walking through the hills
* The third time you will begin exploring new routes
