Middleware provides a next() function

app.use((req,response,next)=>{
  //order of call matters
  console.log(req.method, res.url);
  next();
})

If this function is at the top of the file, every call to express will run this first, then go on.

If you pass next('route') - route is a key word - has a different behavior

middleware functions can be configured - for example express.static('public') configures the public directory

when reviewing code, check the level of the code's complexity and keep it consistents


error handling middleware goes at the bottom of the file
