## class vs function for components

if you don't need state or lifecycle functions, just use a function instead of a class. pass props into the function as parameters

class returns from the render() method, function just returns

dom events - target is the element that the event fires on

if you're setting state based on a previous state or prop value then use the setState function that takes a callback


## redux

combine reducers - each reducer lets us handle a portion of the state. example: handling errors seperately from the data

## thunk

redux middleware - allows us to get the dispatch function inside our action

if you pass a function to an action then the action calls the function and attaches the dispatch (and getState) function

must include thunk as middleware


```const doThing = () => {
  return (dispatch, getState) => {
    type: 'DO_THING',
    payload: 'YO!'
  }
}
```


mapDispatchToProps(dispatch)
this is like componentDidMount - for example get default albums
