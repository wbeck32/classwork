Code Challenge: Prime Numbers
===

Write a function that takes a number `n` and returns all the prime numbers up to the value `n`.

> A prime number is a positive integer this is divisible only by 1 and itself. Thus, 2 and 3 are prime numbers, but 4 isn't, because it's also divisible by 2. Here are the first 15 prime numbers:

```
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
```
