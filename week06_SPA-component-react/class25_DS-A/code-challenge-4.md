Code Challenge: Fibonacci
===

Write a function that takes a number `n` and returns the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence.

> The Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers whereby each new number is the sum of the previous two. By convention, the first two numbers of the series are 0 and 1. These are the first 15 Fibonacci numbers:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377
```
