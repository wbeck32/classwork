forms  immutability

immutable - unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
React makes new copies but only of the parts that change

key tells react that if (key) changes, refresh the dom,

set the key on the Component - search example

mount and unmount refer to inital placement in the DOM, not setState of props

componentWillMount will render empty data, componentdidMount is what you should do

componentwillreceiveprops

const arr1 = ['r', 'b', 'g']
const arr2 =

when updating a value in a large mutable collection, you have to traverse the whole collection

when updating a value in an immutable collection, create new versions of things that represent the state change - for example, just the value that changes

componentShouldUpdate is the React method that specifies which parts need to change

each updated component creates a new obj, old ones can be saved

pass by value vs. pass by reference - doesn't happen in js

variable table - contains var memory address (name) and value

however, objects & functions are too complicated to go into variable table - they go into the heap. the reference to the object goes into the var table

a function also make a copy of the variable

when an object gets reassigned, a new object gets copied to a new address in the heap

when a property of the object gets reassigned, it doesn't copy the object and var table points to the same address



### variable table ###

 var | type | value
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| a | num | 12 |
| obj | obj | 123 heap address


### heap table ###

| address| obj value|  behavior |
|:-----------:|:---:|:---|
| 123 heap street | {name: chuck}| => if just a property of an object is updated, the obj stays at the same address |
|456 heap street | {name: jill}| => if the whole object gets reassigned a new object is created at a new address|

PureComponent - renders whole component, Component doesn't
