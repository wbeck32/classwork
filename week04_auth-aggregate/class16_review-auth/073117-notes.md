An anti-pattern is something that's not expected:

for example: if a get alters the data

JWT: header, payload, signature

Authentication: Are you who you say you are?
Authorization: Are you allowed to do what you want to do?

Need to use "this", can't make it an arrow function

### 3 main parts for auth - can be done sync
- user management
- issue tokens
- authorization - middleware

* checking roles


me route - means currently logged-in user, need to check token

cookie contained session id

dbs stay in one location, sharding splits up data, maybe into A-M, N-P, etc.

servers are expanded horizontally - multiple servers, each one can access the database
stateless architecture - any server can handle any request


node server is single-threaded. a quad core processor can run 4 threads. java, c#, etc. are multi-threaded

single-thread is more efficient because it doesn't have the overhead of thread manipulation
