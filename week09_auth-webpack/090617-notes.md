Feature-based organization -
- potential deep nesting

Asset-based organization
- disadvantage - jumping around

Code splitting -

Redux
inside services directories - api calls

Auth
on server -
* user model
* .get('/verify') route
* ensureAuth middleWare

-- user
-- error

verify - is my token good? (check for token) -> GOT_TOKEN, AUTH_FAILED, FETCHED_USER
signin - GOT_TOKEN, FETCHED_USER
signup - use local storage to save token

GOT_TOKEN - touches token
LOGOUT - touches user
FETCHED_USER - touches user

...rest - not a spread operator, just means take the rest of the properties

const array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const [a, ...rest] = array
a - 1
rest = [2,3,4]

const storage can be localStorage or sessionStorage

this.props.children
children are very similar to DOM children - an
