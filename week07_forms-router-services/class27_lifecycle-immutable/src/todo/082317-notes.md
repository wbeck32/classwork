## controlled vs. uncontrolled forms ##

### uncontrolled inputs/forms ###

In an uncontrolled form the data is stored in the form

In this case, the form is the "source of truth"

but when there's a mismatch between the app and the

we need to use a controlled form and make the app the "source of truth"

use the ref attribute and then componentDidMount gets a ref element to the input once it's in the dom

[ref docs]('https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html')


### controlled inputs/forms ###

Use Component state instead of App state
