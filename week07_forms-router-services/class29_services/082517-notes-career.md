Focus on your particular "brand" and wishes for your job

### Strength testing ###

Gallup strength testing


### Three things ###

Industry, Environment & Culture, Technology

## Industry ##

- data analysis

I enjoy the logic of data and finding patterns in it. I like to think in terms of finding the most relevant results from an aggregate of information. I like to draw conclusions based on patterns.

- social-justice - homelessness and prisoners

I have a lot of empathy for people less fortunate than me and my desire to help people and find solutions to problems are both strong. People who are entitled really annoy me and I feel much happier doing what I can to bring others up. I'm very aware of the very fine line that seperates us all from the poor and persecuted and I believe that all people are equal and deserving of the same opportunities to succeed.

- creative

I like to find new ways to think about things. I like creating and learning different skills that allow me to express my creativity.

B-corp - not required to maximize profits and shareholder profits

## Environment & Culture ##

- employees are encouraged to try out new ideas and are recognized (promotions, bonuses) for successes arising from those ideas

- brand recognition - or a company that has a mission that aligns with my values

- perks - food, beer - not really into a lot of expectations of being required to hang out with co-workers outside of work

- commute on public transportation

- good balance of collaboration and independent work

- opportunity for ownership of a project or component

## Technology ##

- React - MERN stack

- Databases, more likely NoSQL/MongoDB

- Data presentation

- Not Angular

- SCSS, Jade, Express

- Templating - again combines logic and data

- Some "front-end" but definitely not design


## Deal-breakers ##

- excessive commute
- no connection with manager
- no way to grow or advance
- beeper rotation
- no recognition for contributions
- nowhere nearby to get lunch
- not challenging
- too challenging
- don't want to manage people
